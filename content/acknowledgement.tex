During this internship, I worked at the MILES team, and I would like to thank all my colleagues that made this research experience incredible. A special mention to Matteo and Augustin for quality coffee breaks, Lucas and Erwan for their sound advice, and to all the team for their support and kindness.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement during this internship. Thank you Carla for being there for me.
